1.Q) Problems that we're trying to solve. (Think: Why did chatbot come into existence?)/ 

  

ans) A chatbot is a software application used to conduct an on-line chat conversation via text or text-to-speech, 

Designed to convincingly simulate the way a human would behave as a conversational partner, chatbot systems typically require continuous tuning and testing,  

it came in to exitance because of Chatbot applications streamline interactions between people and services, enhancing customer experience. At the same time, 

they offer companies new opportunities to improve the customers engagement process and operational efficiency by reducing the typical cost of customer service, 

Chatbots arose from a very simple request from customers - we want faster answers. With growing companies struggling to meet the demands of incoming questions,  

they turned to a technology that was often seen in science fiction movies: the helpful robot assistant. 

  

Instant replies: Forrester has reported that 73% of customers say that valuing their time is the most important thing a company can do to retain them. 

Customers absolutely love being able to help themselves, find answers quickly and get back to the rest of their lives. 

  

Reduce incoming volume: Every customer service team wishes they had more time in the day so they could spend more time on the things that really matter. 

Using chatbots to answer simple questions frees up your agents for the sticky, difficult questions. It can also help you reduce costs as your customer base grows. 

As you get more customers, your chatbots can handle more questions meaning you donâ€™t need to hire as many agents to support the same number of customers.

3.Q) A Paragraph about how did you start and end the entire assignment. 

   

  ans) 

  first, I have tried with IBM Watson assistance but I was not getting the get request and I was not able to generate the session ID , even I have tried my level best  

    by going through the documentation of API's and other things but after I have tried with google Dialog flow in which I found easy to train the bot but almost I have spent  

    2 days for IBM api so I want to complete it fast so I have created google API for dialogue flow and I have used express in node and next I have downloaded the file  

    which have keys and id details of API form the google console developers and by logging in to dialog flow I have not trained the bot efficiently but it was good enough to give  

    the response next, I have installed json files by running a command (NPM init) and installed dialog flow and some required files after that I got a reference code from git to 

    get the session id and to pull the request form API's somehow, I have managed to Debug the errors by taking reference from stack overflow website and then I have connected  

    with frond end which I have got form open-source files in git hub so that's how I made a chatbot web page. thank you
